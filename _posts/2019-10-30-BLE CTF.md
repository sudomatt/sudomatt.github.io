<img align="left" src="/images/ctf.jpg">  CTF stands for 'Capture the Flag', a means for hackers to test their chops in breaching simulated systems with specific securety flaws.  As it happens, <a href="https://github.com/hackgnar/">hackgnar<a> set up a wonderful Bluetooth Low Energy <a href="https://github.com/hackgnar/https://github.com/hackgnar/ble_ctf">CTF</a> to teach folks about server client interactions over BLE. I highly recommend you approach this from scratch before looking for help, struggling a bit is often the best way to learn.   Unfortunately, I'm shit at BASH programming, so I needed to dive a bit deeper to figure out what the hell I was doing, even with a cursory knowledge of BLE.  Here is my walkthrough for those of you with a similar knowledge base.

It's run off of an ESP32 with freely availble firmware from github, or you can buy pre-flashed versions for $20.  I tried the latter, got sick of waiting, and went with the former.

I did the CTF in kali, it works nicely. I also used 'bleah', a handy BLE enumeration tool that makes everything much more human readable.


enter 'bleah' into your terminal to get a nice view of the bluetooth world around us

Look for a device labeled BLECTF, and find it's MAC address.  Mine was 3c:71:bf:84:b9:ca

***image***

Enter bleah -b 3c:71:bf:84:b9:ca -e

-b : connect to a specific mac address
-e : ennumerate, make it human readable and pretty

You should get something like this:

You've made it to the starting line!  Several scripts are reccomended to make things easier

submit.sh - a shell script that submits flags to the correct service in order to score points

#!/bin/bash

gatttool -b $MAC --char-wrte-req -a 0x002c -n $(echo -n "\$1" | xxd -ps)

gatttool	|use gatttool|
-b		|feed it a mac address|
$MAC		|Actual mac address of your BLECTF device|
--char-write-req|Make a request to write a character|
-a 		|specify writing to a handle|
0x002c		|the handle that stores the score|
-n		|going to be writing a value|
echo		|display a line of text|
-n              ?? NEW LINE?
"\$1"		?? FIRST CHARACTER INPUT
|		|pipe it!|
xxd		|hex dump of a text file
-ps		|Output in a postscript plain hexdump style
