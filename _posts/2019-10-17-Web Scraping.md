I very much enjoy craigslist.  It's a nice way to reuse instead of consume, save some cash, and has been a particularly good wellspring of projects.  Unfortunately, the best deals at the best prices tend to get snatched up in a matter of minutes or hours.  We COULD spend hours of the day endlessly refreshing craigslist.  Or... we could make a script do it.  Webscraping is a means of collecting useful information from a public website and using it in a computer program.  BeautifulSoup4 is a library in Python3 that allows webscraping to be done much more easily.
